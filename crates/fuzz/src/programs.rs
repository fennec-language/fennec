//! The `programs` target: random, well-typed programs, each built as a dev build and with
//! `--release`, which have to print the same and fail the same way, and run by a reference
//! evaluator written here, which has to agree with them where it's sure. A program prints every
//! value it makes when its block ends, so what it prints is a digest of everything it did.
//!
//! The programs come from a tree (`ast`) that the bytes choose (`generate`), written out as
//! Fennec (`source`) and run by the evaluator (`eval`) without the compiler. They hunt what the
//! audits found by hand: checks taken out on a proof that's wrong, copies that share what they
//! shouldn't, and the order assignments go in.
